# Configuring a PingFederate instance with the Alfresco Identity Service

The Identity Service can be configured to use PingFederate as an identity provider. The following steps detail this configuration.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed the Identity Service before starting. You will also need to have administrative access to your instance of PingFederate.

## Configuration
There are three main steps involved in configuring a PingFederate instance with the Identity Service:

1. Obtain your parameters from PingFederate.
2. Configure the Identity Service with your PingFederate parameters.
3. Configure your PingFederate connection.

### 1. Obtain parameters from PingFederate
1. Sign in to your PingFederate instance as a user with administrative privileges.
2. Select **Server Settings** from the **System Settings** menu.
3. Make a note of the value for *My Base URL* under the **Federation Info** heading.
4. Click **Main** and select **Federation Settings** or **IdP Configuration**, then click **Protocol Endpoints**.
5. Make a note of the values for *Single Logout (SLO) Service* and *Single Sign-on (SSO) Service* under the **SAML v2.0 Endpoints** heading.
6. Combine the value of *My Base URL* (from Step 3) with *Single Logout (SLO) Service* and *My Base URL* (from Step 3) with *Single Sign-on (SSO) Service* ready to enter into the Identity Service.

For example:
> If *My Base URL* is `"https://pingfederate.test.com:9031"` and *Single Sign Logout (SLO) Service* is `"/idp/SLO.saml2"` then the POST SLO service URL is `https://pingfederate.test.com:9031/idp/SLO.saml2`

### 2. Configure the Identity Service
1. Sign in to the administrator panel of the Identity Service using the following URL: `https://$ELBADDRESS/auth/admin`

   **Note:** The `$ELBADDRESS` will be the one used [during deployment](../../README.md).

2. Select the correct realm to configure PingFederate against.

   **Note:** If using the default deployment options, the realm will be called `Alfresco`.

3. In the **Settings** of each client (`alfresco` and `activiti` if using the default deployment options) save the following configuration:

   * Switch **Implicit Flow Enabled** on.
   * Enter `https://$ELBADDRESS*` in **Valid Redirect URIs**.
   * Click **+** and enter your application front end URI into the next line of **Valid Redirect URIs**.

4. Select **Identity Providers** from the left hand navigation menu and choose *SAML v2.0* in the **Add Provider** dropdown.
5. Enter the values you obtained from PingFederate in the first section into **Single Sign-On Service URL** and **Single Logout Service URL**.
6. Make the following configurations:

   * Choose *Unspecified* in the **NameID Policy Format** dropdown.
   * Switch **HTTP-POST Binding Response** on.
   * Switch **HTTP-POST Binding for AuthnRequest** on.
   * Switch **HTTP-POST Binding Logout** on.
   * Switch **Want AuthnRequests Signed** on.
   * Choose the appropriate algorithm for your setup from the dropdown in **Signature Algorithm**.
   * Choose *NONE* in the **SAML Signature Key Name** dropdown.

7. After clicking **Save**, navigate to the **Mappers** tab and select **Create**.
8. Make the following configurations:

   * Choose *Attribute Importer* from the **Mapper Type** dropdown.
   * Enter *email* into **Name**.
   * Enter *EMAIL* into **Attribute Name**.
   * Enter *email* into **User Attribute Name**.

9. After clicking **Save** navigate back to the **Identity Provider Mappers** using the breadcrumb and select the **Export** tab.
10. **Download** and make a note of the file name and download location.
11. Create a file with the extension `.cert` (the file name isn't important other than to locate it later on) with the following content:

    ```
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

12. Open the file you downloaded in Step 10 with a text editor.
13. Find the line beginning with the tag `<dsig:X509Certificate>` and ending with `</dsig:X509Certificate>`.
![X509 Certificate from export](./keycloak-export-cert.png)
14. Copy the string in-between these tags and paste the content into the file you created in Step 11 in-between `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and
    `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`.
    
The contents of your `.cert` file should now look similar to the following:

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIICnzCCAYcCBgFkqEAQCDANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADATMREwDwYDVQQDDAhhbGZyZXNjbzA
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### 3. Configure your PingFederate connection

1. Sign in to your PingFederate instance as a user with administrative privileges.
2. Navigate to **SP Connections** and select **Create New**.
